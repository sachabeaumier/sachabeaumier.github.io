  <h2>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h2>
  <p>
    The main difference between padding and margin is that padding controls how much breathing room exists within a box, while margin controls how much breathing room or whitespace exists outside of a box. 
    Borders represents the edge of a CSS box which extends around the pudding and the content, the margin is 0, being invisible, but it is possible to set the style, thickness or color of the border.

  <h2>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</h2>
  <p>
  Class and Id are selectors used to organize styling elements within CSS code.
  The Class selector is used to identify and group multiple elements (ie class) whilst IDs on the other hand are unique to specific elements and as a general rule should only be used once

    <h2>What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?</h2>
  <p>Static - this is the default value, all elements are in order as they appear in the document.</p> 
  
  <p>Relative - the element is positioned relative to its normal position.</p>
  <p>Absolute - the element is positioned absolutely to its first positioned parent.</p>
  
  <p>Fixed - the element is positioned related to the browser window.</p>

  <h2>What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?  </h2>

  <p>display: block means that the element is displayed as a block, as paragraphs and headers have always been. A block has some whitespace above and below it and tolerates no HTML elements next to it, except when ordered otherwise (by adding a float declaration to another element, for instance).</p>

   <p> display: inline means that the element is displayed inline, inside the current block on the same line. Only when it's between two blocks does the element form an 'anonymous block', that however has the smallest possible width.</p>
