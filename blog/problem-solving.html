    <h2>
      1. were blocked on a simple problem:

      what was the problem?
      what problem-solving techniques did you use?
      how did you feel throughout the process?
      what did you learn?
    </h2>

    <p>
      Stupid things like spelling mistakes (ie capitalization/camelCasing/case sensitivity)
      were easy issues that I came across that were easily solved by going through line by line to
      see if there were any simple issues parsing in variable names and confusing naming conventions of object values and
      variables.

      2. elegantly solved a problem.
      what was the problem?
      what problem-solving techniques did you use?

      what did you learn?
      </h2>
    

    <p class="answer">
      Breaking down problems into subproblems was immensely useful and then assessing/comparing 
      these subproblems waiting to be solved against the corpus of previous
      code (functions/subroutines/declared variables etc) completed. Trying to see
      what I have previously solved and whether the solutions conceived is applicable
      towards new problems was immensely useful to my learning as well as finding out 
      the blindspots in my knowledge that needed to be supplimented through
      googling out extra solutions etc etc.

    <h2>3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these 
      problem-solving techniques/processes:</h2>
       <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
      <p>
       Pseudocode is useful insofar as providing a guideline about how to go about
       solving a problem. Planning ahead of time as to what you need to tackle and preempting known issues
       that require solving gives you a plan to use other problemsolving tools and techniques as per the following...
  
      </p>
      <h3>Trying something</h3>
      <p>Trying something and throwing things up to the wall can be useful insofar
        as having some sort of instructive guide or parameters of action to use against.
        One can be easily led on a goose chase if you just go in blind without some sort of goal
        or objective in sight. Knowing what to try is 90% more useful than throwing spaghetti at the walls.
      </p>
  
  
  
 

  
    <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
    <P>Really useful in conjunction with googling StackOverflow threads
       as the errors raised within the console.log presents great learning opportunities
       and points towards quirks and design architecture that's endemic towards a programming 
       language paradigm. Continual errors I kept coming against were in regards to certain inbuilt methods
       being only applicable to specific data types (ie the inability to push objects, the differences between dot and bracket notations which 
       effected the types of methods I could use for certain problems and challenges)
    </P>
     <h3>Asking your peers for help, Asking coaches for help, Improving your process with reflection</h3>
    <p>
     Peers, colleagues and Coaches are all useful resources to ask for assistance/help, as well as to help clarify ones own understanding or
     knowledge on a topic as it presents an opportunity for us to test our own knowledge and understanding. Being able to come
     and break through this mental roadblock of reaching out can be difficult (i.e. how much toil and self work must one do before we should reach out is a question one
     is constantly asking oneself). It can be issue as fundamentally we are all responsible for our own self-learning (trying to walk this tightrope can be an issue?)
