  <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
 
  <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
  <p>My career pathway is to work within the software engineering sphere - with an aim to work in full stack development roles (would also like to opportunity to maybe transition into devOps).
    Ideally I would like to pick up the necessary tools and skills in devacademy to be able to unify the skills required to enter these roles as well as the competencies required to be able to make
    transitions to other tech adjacent roles should i choose to.
    On a more personal note, I am also interested in digital design and digital arts, so

  </p>

  <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
  <p>
   
    I have previous programming skills in OOP languages (C# and Java) and have some understanding already of webstack/IT technologies mostly within the data analytics domain (LAMP stack, SQL, MongoDB, IBM Watson, Python/Anacondas (ie data science libraries)). 
    Limitations when it comes to learning is perhaps a lack of real world experience in collaborative learning/programming and a more theoretical rather than practical understanding of programming/computer science.
    Another limitation could be my background in the social sciences (have solid calculus and statistic skills but may need to sharpen some of my maths skill).
    On a personal note, would like to improve my technical skills when it comes to errortesting and debugging (ie I guess this is a softskill insofar as learning how to navigate stackoverflow)

  
  </p>

  <h2>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
  <p>
    I would like to improve my understanding around essential work practises demanded in the software engineering tech space (i.e. some improved understanding of agile and collaborative working as well as career tips and tricks to get into the industry).
    Ideally career skills would be developed to help me gain a full stack development/software engineering role.
    Would also like to learn the necessary skills to maintain upkeep when it comes to learning new tools and technologies going forward.
    Project management skills would be useful as well as skills relating to understanding design philosophy especially as it pertains to user centric designs (UI/UX knowledge etc).
  </p>


  <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:

    An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
    What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h2>
  
  <p>
   Try to be as transparent and honest about a situation (ofc within reason). Often things can build if there isnt open communication
   amongst all parties within a stressful team situation (we all should acknowledge that we have faults and limitations and take on constructive feedback when applicable).
   In conjunction with this is a commitment to working towards deadlines and timeboxing as any lateness on my part will have downstream impacts on my colleagues (this isnt a recurring problem but am aware that I am in a team collaborative environment). 
  </p>

  <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
  <p>
   My commitment to asking for assistance will be predicated on engagement with online channels (ie dischord with fellow colleagues, then escalation to the Facilitators etc)
   where all other avenues have been exhausted (ie stackoverflow etc). 
   Keeping my tasks in line with pomodoro timekeeping techniques, I am aware that being stuck unneccessarily on tasks
   can take up time that can be better placed in other domains of learning and can halt timely progression through
   the syllabus.
  </p>

  <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
  <p>
    Serious and timely review of work submitted from myself and other students, coupled with a commitment to constructive feedback on what we are doing.
    We also have an expectation that the facilitation team take their work as seriously as we the students do and that they provide the learning tools and experiences required for us to succeed in our future endeavours and to enable us to learn the tools/knowledge required for us to succeed within the tech industry.
    Another expectation is that we the students will be pushed and challenged by the material provided and are given a learning structure that forces us to engage deeply with material being taught to us.
  </p>

  <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h2>
  <p>I may have to set time out over a weekend to see my partner whom I am seeing long distance.
     As I understand the time pressures involved with the course, I have set out some limited time during one weekend where I can see her as to not effect my present commits with Devacademy.
     Other than that, my schedule is fairly free and loose.

  </p>
