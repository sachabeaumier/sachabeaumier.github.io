  <h2>What is the DOM</h2>
  <p>
    
    The DOM, otherwise known as the Direct Object Model is an application interface
    that mediates between HTML and XML documents 
    and  defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.
    This allows us to create, change, or remove elements from the document, as well as add events to these elements to make our page more dynamic.
    The DOM views an HTML document as a tree of nodes. A node represents an HTML element.

    Control Flow and Introduction to Loops
  </h2>
  <p>
    Control flow in JavaScript is how the computer runs code 
    from the top of a page to the bottom. It starts from the first line 
    and ends at the final line, until it hits any statement that 
    changes the control flow of the program i.e. loops, conditionals, or functions. 
    One can think of Control Flow as like a road from the start and end of our destination.
    The control of this ride would be handled by the likes of traffic lights, traffic diversions and pedestrian crossings
    which dictate how we get to our destination.
    Loops are iteration statements that will keep 
    running until there is either nothing left to loop over, 
    or if the condition becomes false. 
    Loops within this analogy can be thought of as the traffic lights or diversionary routes in a roading system that provides 
    flow/logic that define the parameters of how the flow is controlled.

  <h2>What are functions and how are they helpful?</h2>

  <p>Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. 
    A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, 
    but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship 
    between the input and the output. 
  </p>

  <h2>Arrays & Objects</h2>

  <p>Objects are used to represent a “thing” in your code. 
    This could be a person, a car, a building, a book, a character in a game, a user — 
    basically anything that is made up or can be defined by a set of characteristics (i.e. person's name, person's age, person's email address). 
    In objects, these characteristics are called properties that consist of a key and a value.
  </p>
  <p>
    Arrays are used when we want to create and store a list/collection of multiple items within 
    a single variable. Arrays are especially useful when creating ordered collections 
    where items in the collection can be accessed by their numerical position in the 
    list. Just as object properties can store values of any primitive data type (as well as an array or another object), 
    so too can arrays consist of strings, numbers, booleans, objects, or even other arrays.
    Arrays use zero-based indexing system, so the first item in an array has an index of 0, the second item an index of 1, and so on.
