  <h1>Identity Values</h1>

  <h2>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h2>
  <p>Making any sort of choice is invariably caught up with questions concerning ethic and the predicable consequences actions may have on others around ourselves. </p>
  

  <h2>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h2>
  <p>The preponderance of culture to shape and define the parameters of a society’s value system shouldn’t be underestimated in also defining the ethical and moral horizons of the individual. 
    Coming from a working class background, the horizon of possibilities of what one can do in life is fairly limited compared to others in societies with more resources at their disposal (be it monetary, social networks, or what have you). 
    Given these limitations, I would say I am someone who has to try and work with less resources which I guess becomes a identity value (resourcefulness, disciplined, thrifty etc).</p>

  <h2>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h2>
  <p>Having taken the VIA Institute Survey, apparently my top attribute is kindness and humility (not sure how accurate that is?). Nevertheless I do think these traits are important insofar as integrating a kind and welcoming approach when dealing with colleagues within a group/class dynamic. This is quite important in that working as a collective is much more beneficial than working as an individual in terms of achieving our aims and goals.

  <h2>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h2>
  <p>Coming from the university system where abstraction and theoretical knowledge is placed greater emphasis than practical experiential learning/pedagogy, making this adjustment is a consideration in my learning journey. Going from the prompts provided and the readings conducted, hard repetition in order to build muscle memory is something I will also need to get used to.</p>

  <h2>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h2>
  <p>During the last covid in Auckland, I was leading a team on a project and understandably, a lot of us working were stressed out and had diminished enthusiasm given the pressure of the situation. In some situations, its probably best to let go and just realise that some things are just out of our control and that the best we can do is try and do our best with the controllable variables we have at hand. For example, within our team - we all had the same sense of frustration, stress and loneliness that came with sustained isolation. In order to mitigate this within a team context, we initiated a group zoom weekly catch up where we can just simply drop in and chat (whether the conversation is or isn’t work related became incidental) simply because we needed some sort of mechanism to just release tension. We did notice that simply providing a caring work environment that valued a healthy workplace rather simply the narrow parameters of KPIs and targets consequentially made us more productive when tested against project groups who didn’t initiate such initiatives.</p>
