  <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about 
    yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>

  <p>
    The importance and awareness of neuroplasticity within the learning processing
    was quite illuminating i.e. realizing that the need to strengthen muscle memory as 
    a means to improve one's coding ability. 

  </p>


<h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and 
programming?</h2>
<p>
  Fundamentally, programming is a collaborative exercise where contributers 
  delegated different tasks and respobsibilities. Being aware of how to function as a team 
  requires high levels of empathy and self-awareness in the way you treat yourself and others 
  but also in how you teach yourself and others. Learning can be difficult, so to remind
  yourself to be kind is an important skill to cultivate.
</p>


<h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
<p>
  Putting onto paper, ways of learning that are intuitively understood 
  about how to learn technical skills. The explanations given in the core modules
  like neuroplasticity and how a greater understanding of brain or cognitive science
  can enable one to make more efficient ones learning was a pleasant suprise.
</p>




<h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
<p>
  Some of the content can be hairy-fairy or newagey, I think overcoming these
  prejudices might be a barrier. To be honest, the most challenging aspects of core 
  learning at the moment is the lack of team work we've had so far in applying some of
  this knowledge.
</p>




<h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on 
  core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
  <p>As reiterated above, programming is often a collaborative endeavour and to
    be able to function successfully within this environment requires high level
    EQ in order to help negotiate personal relationships within this dynamic.
  </p>
<h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? 
  Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
  </h2>
  <p>I feel perhaps there has not so much application of the core learning within 
    the foundations stage of the course (though I imagine in due course this learning will be applied).
    Core learning didnt' feel like a waste of time at all.
