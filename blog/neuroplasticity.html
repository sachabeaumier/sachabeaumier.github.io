        How does understanding the principles of neuroplasticity beneficial?
      </h2>
    <p>
      Neuroplasticity is an umbrella term for the brain’s ability to change over a lifetime. Our brains have a high degree of malleability with which to adapt to new situations. Neural pathways can reorganize from exposure to environmental stimuli such as certain experiences, learning new things, or memorizing new information. Once we understand that the exertion of agency towards our own learning has consequential effects in the way our brains develop, this open a whole range of tools that we can use towards persevering in learning new skills and talents. We can influence our brain development in positive or negative directions. The more we engage and challenge our mind and body, the longer our brains function at a high level. There are also many other benefits to encouraging neuroplastic change.
    </p>

    <h2>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.
    </h2>

    <p>
      Neuroplastic change occurs at the chemical, structural and functional levels of the brain. These changes work in concert with one another.

      <bold>Chemical change</bold> occurs in the initial stages of learning something new. Chemical change primarily influences short-term memory or short-term improvement in a motor skill.

      <bold>Structural change</bold> occurs when neurons in the brain change their connections, altering your brains structure. This type of change requires more effort and time. It involves long-term memory and long-term improvement of a motor skill.

      <bold>Functional change</bold> occurs when entire brain networks change. These brain networks, as they are used over and over again, become more excitable and more efficient when activated.

      The more the brain is exercised, the stronger and more connected it becomes. The connections occur across the brain’s grey and white matter. Grey matter is neural tissue that includes regions of the brain involved in muscle control, sensory perception (e.g., seeing, hearing), memory, emotions, speech, decision-making and self-control. White matter connects grey matter regions together.

    <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
      <p>Engaging in things that require tactile engagement/activity is highly encouraged. Things like learning an instrument, programming are examples of this  
      tactile engagement and encourages associations & linkages between muscle and brain memory. Things like language learning is also an activity that encourages
      neuroplasticity (when one is language learning, you will often need to memorize
      vocab and engage in language use via forms of speaking and writing).

        <p>
          A useful thinker about this topic is the 20th century philosopher Martin Heideggar who pre-figures these ideas through the notion of phenemenology.
          To understand the world in a substantive and philosophically consistent way
          is to engage with it (ie to program and/or physically engage/understand something in tactile way is just as, if more important than detached abstract understanding through highly thereotical reading where there is little incentive to apply theory towards everyday praxis)
          regarding this topic. Difficult forms of knowledge requires repition and hard engagement, and to get over this hump requires dedication - therefore these skills/learning on neuroplasticity provides useful utility towards this aim of understanding.
