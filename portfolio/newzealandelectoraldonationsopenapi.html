  <h1>New Zealand Political Party Donors Tracker API (ongoing/in development)</h1>
  <h2>A non-partisan and publicly available API to track 
    donors and donations made to New Zealand political parties</h2>
    <p>Using mainly Python's BeautifulSoup package for parsing HTML documents, I am 
      scraping, cleaning and analyzing data from the New Zealand Electoral Commission website on financial donors
      of New Zealand political parties and repurposing it as a publicly accessible API
      for the purposes of political transparency and consumption by journalists, academics and the general public at large. Further work is being undertaken to analyze the data and tag donors 
      to companies they are associated with, as well as the industries they are representing and other interesting information such as tax domicile.
